	You may need to give the shell scripts executable privileges
	Enter the directory and execute these 3 commands

chmod +x encrypt.sh
chmod +x decrypt.sh
chmod +x delete.sh

	to execute, enter the main directory and enter the following 

./encrypt.sh
./decrypt.sh
./delete.sh

	To create terminal shortcuts, edit your bash profile by entering this command,

nano .zprofile

	and add the following lines to that file

alias enc=./quickCrypt/qcrypt.sh
alias dec=./quickCrypt/qdcrypt.sh
alias del=./quickCrypt/qdcryptdel.sh

You now may use "enc", "dec", and "del" as shortcuts for these scripts
